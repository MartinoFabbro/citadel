The act of stealing industrial advancements can be carried out in different ways:

**Access and Theft:** When a blueprint is shared, the recipient gains temporary access to view and use the blueprint for a specific purpose (e.g., building a ship). During this access period, the recipient has the opportunity to copy the blueprint and any associated research advancements.

**Killing and Hacking Structures:** Blueprint advancements can also be stolen by attacking and destroying or hacking the structures where they are being researched or used. Players must protect their research facilities from enemy attacks and espionage attempts.

The owner of the bp is notified if the structure where the bp is located is being attacked or the hacking attempt fails.

**Let's make an example:**

Alex has a blueprint for a standard interceptor. Over time, Alex invests resources and time to research and improve this blueprint, enhancing its performance and efficiency. This makes Alex’s interceptor blueprint one of the best on the market.

**Sharing for Construction:** Alex needs Jamie’s help to build a fleet of interceptors. Alex shares the advanced blueprint with Jamie, providing access for a limited period and for the specific purpose of constructing the ships.

**Theft Opportunity:** During the access period, Jamie sees the potential value in Alex’s advancements and decides to copy the blueprint. Alex is none the wiser. Kevin was told about this industrial endeavour and used hacking equipment from his ship to access the factory Jamie is building interceptors at. Oh no! The factory detected the hacking attempt and reported Kevin to the factory owner. Poor Kevin got kicked from the alliance.
