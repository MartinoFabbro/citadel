The act of stealing industrial advancements can be carried out in different ways:

**Access and Theft:** When a blueprint is shared, the recipient gains temporary access to view and use the blueprint for a specific purpose (e.g., building a ship). During this access period, the recipient has the opportunity to copy the blueprint and any associated research advancements.

**Killing and Hacking Structures:** Blueprint advancements can also be stolen by attacking and destroying or hacking the structures where they are being researched. Players must protect their research facilities from enemy attacks and espionage attempts.

The owner of the bp is notified if the structure where the bp is located is being attacked or hacked.

**Encryption and Security:** Blueprints can be encrypted to add a layer of security. Players must invest in encryption technologies to protect their blueprints. Higher levels of encryption make it harder and more time-consuming for others to decrypt and steal the blueprints.

**Let's make an example:**

Alex has a blueprint for a standard interceptor. Over time, Alex invests resources and time to research and improve this blueprint, enhancing its performance and efficiency. This makes Alex’s interceptor blueprint one of the best on the market.

**Sharing for Construction:** Alex needs Jamie’s help to build a fleet of interceptors. Alex shares the advanced blueprint with Jamie, providing access for a limited period and for the specific purpose of constructing the ships.

**Theft Opportunity:** During the access period, Jamie sees the potential value in Alex’s advancements and decides to copy the blueprint. Jamie’s attempt to copy triggers Alex’s counter-espionage measures, which include digital watermarking and alerts.

**Counter-Espionage Response:** Alex receives an alert about the unauthorized copying attempt. The encryption slows Jamie down, giving Alex time to respond. Alex confronts Jamie about the theft attempt, and depending on the in-game mechanics, Alex might take action such as revoking access, reporting Jamie to their alliance, or seeking compensation through insurance.
