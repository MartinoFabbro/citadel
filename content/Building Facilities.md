The building process varies depending on the size and complexity of the structures being built, with smaller ships being constructed within industrial outposts or specialized ships and larger ships and outposts requiring in-space construction.

### Building Small Ships

**Industrial Outpost Facilities:**

- **Construction Process:** Small ships can be built inside industrial outposts or specialized ships equipped with shipyard modules. These facilities provide the necessary tools, resources, and space to assemble smaller vessels efficiently.
  
- **Resource Requirements:** Building a ship (or an outpost) requires various raw materials, such as metals, electronics, and fuel. Players must gather these resources from mining operations or trade.
  
- **[[Blueprints]]:** Players use blueprints to construct ships. These blueprints can be obtained through research, trade and dictate the specifications and required ideal materials for the ship.

- **[[Industry]]:** The construction process involves allocating resources to the shipyard, selecting the blueprint, and initiating the build. The shipyard’s capabilities, such as production speed and capacity, can be enhanced with structure upgrades and specialized modules.

### Building Large Ships and Outposts

**In-Space Construction:**

- **Construction Platforms:** Large ships and outposts require dedicated construction platforms in space. These platforms can be built in orbit around structures, outposts or in specific locations within sectors. Alternatively, they can be Assembled in space by specialized ships.
  
- **Resource Gathering and Transport:** Players must transport the necessary resources to the building site.
  
- **Blueprints and Modules:** Similar to small ships, large ships and outposts are built using blueprints. These blueprints detail the structure’s specifications and required materials. Large ships and outposts are constructed in "modules", with each module or segment requiring specific resources and assembly time. Alternatively.  Modules can be build inside outposts and hauled to the location where the ship/outpost is being assembled

- **Assembly Process:** The construction process involves multiple stages:
    1. **Foundation:** Laying the initial framework or foundation of the ship or outpost.
       
    2. **Modular Construction:** Assembling various modules such as command centers, storage units, defensive systems, and production facilities. Each module is built separately and then integrated into the overall structure.
       
    3. **Final Assembly:** Once all modules are completed, the final assembly can start.
