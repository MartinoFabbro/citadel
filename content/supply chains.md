### Transpiration of resources

The transportation of resources between outposts, is one of the most important aspects of the game. Efficient supply chains are vital for maintaining and expanding player influence across the sectors. As we mentioned the most crucial resources that need transportation are various minerals and fuels, the latter often transported via fuel tankers and pipelines.

There are different ways to transport resources between potshots in the game, some being more efficient than others,

**Fuel Pipelines:** For more permanent or semi-permanent installations, fuel pipelines can be constructed to connect outposts in fuel-rich areas directly to other nearby outposts or through a network of pipelines across multiple sectors. Pipelines offer a more efficient, though fixed, method of fuel transportation, reducing the need for tanker ships but requiring significant upfront construction and maintenance costs. They also pose strategic vulnerabilities as they can become targets for sabotage or territorial disputes.

**Fuel Tankers:** Fuel tankers are spacecraft fitted with enough cargo bays (_see fitting chapter_) to transport large quantities of fuel from extraction points in fuel-rich sectors to where it's needed most. These tankers are built to handle the volatile nature of fuel, usually equipped with heavy armor and often escorted by defensive ships to protect against pirates and enemy factions aiming to disrupt the supply chain. The design and operation of fuel tankers require significant investment, but they are essential for sustaining large-scale operations and fleet movements.
Fuel tankers are a less efficient way to transport fuel but they are a more flexible than pipelines, they are usually involved in conflict operations or in case of contested fuel nebulae.

Fuel tankers are less efficient over longer distances.

**Mineral Transport:** Minerals are primarily transported via cargo ships, which may vary in size and capacity depending on the volume and distance of the transport route. Like fuel tankers, these ships can be targets for hostile actions, necessitating armed escorts or stealth capabilities.
