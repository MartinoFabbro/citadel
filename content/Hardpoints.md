Hardpoints are external openings to the ship that allow equipment to interact with the world. They are also the [[Weak Points]] of a ship; by giving what's inside a way out, what's outside can also find a way in.

Hardpoints come in three different types:
* Engine hardpoints; can only fit engines. These hardpoints have an open and direct connection the fuel and are therefore a massive weak point.
* Electronical hardpoints; can only fit electronic equipment such as sensors. This hardpoint's only weakness is the connected equipment's destruction.
* Open hardpoint; can everything but engines. These hardpoints are few and valuable, so will primarily be used for the ship's primary function such a turrets, drone bays, or mining equipment. This hardpoint's direct connection to ship's inside is a weak point, though less critical than the engine hardpoint.

Hardpoints come in different sizes that correspond to the [[Fitting Space]] squares:
* small; one square wide.
* medium; two squares wide.
* large; four squares wide.
* capital; eight squares wide.
