**(Tier 1)**

- **Description:** Basic materials with low purity. They are widely available and provide standard performance.
- **Attributes:** Suitable for basic construction needs but offer no significant enhancements.
- **Use Case:** Ideal for entry-level ships and items where advanced performance is not required.

 **(Tier 2)**

- **Description:** Materials with better purity than basic quality, offering improved performance.
- **Attributes:** Enhanced durability, efficiency, and effectiveness compared to Tier 1 materials.
- **Use Case:** Used for mid-tier constructions that require better performance and durability.

**(Tier 3)**

- **Description:** High-quality materials that provide significant enhancements to various attributes.
- **Attributes:** Superior strength, conductivity, and other key properties. Harder to find but highly valuable.
- **Use Case:** Essential for high-performance ships and advanced technologies.

**(Tier 4)**

- **Description:** Premium materials offering exceptional performance boosts.
- **Attributes:** Very high durability, efficiency, and other critical attributes. Rare and valuable.
- **Use Case:** Critical for elite constructions and top-tier equipment.

**(Tier 5)**

- **Description:** The highest quality materials with unmatched performance and efficiency.
- **Attributes:** Maximum durability, unmatched effectiveness, and supreme efficiency. Extremely rare.
- **Use Case:** Reserved for the most advanced and powerful ships, outposts, and items.

### Material Attributes

Each material tier affects specific attributes crucial for crafting and performance: (see [[Blueprints]])

- **Strength:** Determines the durability and resistance of the material.
- **Conductivity:** Affects electrical and thermal conductivity, crucial for electronic components.
- **Hardness:** Impacts the material's resistance to physical damage.
- **Elasticity:** Influences flexibility and resistance to stress.
- **Density:** Affects the weight and overall mass of the constructed item.

### Refining Process

Materials can be refined to improve their quality: (see [[Processing and Refining]])

- **Initial Extraction:** Raw materials are mined in their most unrefined state, containing various impurities.
- **First Refining Cycle:** Basic refineries process raw materials, reducing impurities and increasing concentration.
- **Subsequent Cycles:** Advanced refineries further purify the materials, with each cycle improving quality but resulting in some material loss.
