Equipment are three dimensional objects that are projected onto a two dimensional plane in [[Fitting Space]]. They are further projected onto one dimensional [[Hardpoints]].
While equipment are intentionally not uniform in shape, they can be averaged to be square for fitting purposes and cubical for building purposes. 

| size    | width | squared | cubed |
| ------- | ----- | ------- | ----- |
| small   | 1     | 1       | 1     |
| medium  | 2     | 4       | 8     |
| large   | 4     | 16      | 64    |
| capital | 8     | 64      | 512   |
As seen here, the width is the hardpoint size and representative of the equipment's power. The space occupied by the equipment is its width squared. The build cost of the equipment is its width cubed.
The power is comparable between equipment of the same group, not all equipment. A large-sized anti-frigate weapon that would fit on a battleship is approximately four times stronger than a small-sized anti-frigate weapon that would fit on a frigate.
