This document outlines the detailed design plan for Citadel, a game that aims to reshape the boundaries of strategic multiplayer environments. This document serves as the cornerstone for the development of a vast, dynamic universe where player decisions and interactions shape the course of the game's evolving narrative and complex ecosystem.

Our game is set in a complex universe where power, resources, and territory are constantly changing. Players will navigate through a world where their strategic choices not only influence their own survival and prosperity but also impact the broader dynamics of the game environment.

The following key concepts form the backbone of our game’s design:

1. **Dynamic [[World Structure]]**: Players will engage with a changing universe where environmental factors such as asteroid storms, cosmic anomalies, and solar flares directly impact players strategies.  
    Players will have to deal and take advantage of the environmental diversity present in the game world, choke points, clearings, tunnels, pockets are all scenarios that will have to be carefully analyzed in order to take the best strategic decisions.
    
2. **Advanced Diplomacy and Espionage**: Our game allows players to forge alliances, engage in diplomatic negotiations, and conduct covert operations against rivals.  
    Players will engage in the exploration of uncharted and hostile territories ([[Movement, Travel, Exploration and Migrations]]), relying on their ship's radar systems to navigate and either evade or engage enemies for survival.
    
3. **Complex Economic System**: The game's core is a dynamic economy shaped by player decisions, with supply and demand affecting market conditions and resources. Strong alliances with resilient supply chains will thrive, while others will struggle to support their industry and military.
    
4. **Technology [[Research]] and Development**: Players will invest in technology, unlocking new ships capabilities, and modules as they progress through an unlimited industry progression system.
    
5. **Player Roles and Specializations**: From miners and builders to commanders and spies, players can choose specialized career paths that offer unique gameplay experiences and opportunities for advancement.
    
6. **[[Customization of Ships and Outposts (Fittings)]]**: Players can customize ships and bases to meet their tactical needs using the Ship Fitting Mechanic. This feature allows players to turn a basic spaceship into a fully functional vessel that suits their strategic preferences and gameplay style.
    
7. **Reputation and Influence Systems**: Actions within the game will impact a player’s reputation other players, opening up new opportunities or presenting unexpected challenges.
    
8. **Arduous [[Movement, Travel, Exploration and Migrations]]:** Traveling through the expansive Citadel galaxy will require players to invest time and effort. There are no shortcuts or teleportation available. Travel will be dangerous and time-consuming.
    
9. **[[Resources]] and gathering**: Resource extraction is a key aspect of gameplay, as each resource in the game has unique attributes that affect their usefulness in crafting items and ships. Resources vary in durability, conductivity, density, and other qualities. It's important to note that resources are not uniformly distributed across the map, leading to some regions being better suited for building certain items and ships.  Resources are limited. Once valuable minerals are exhausted from an area (or a galaxy), maintaining an alliance there becomes difficult. Migration to better opportunities will be the only option for those seeking growth.
    
10. **Player-driven [[NPE]]:** New Player Experience will be mostly driven by their peers, pilots will be immediately integrated into a social environment, and alliances will be responsible for guiding players during their initial experiences in the universe.
    
11. **Different layers of [[combat]]**: Combat in the game is a complex experience that goes beyond just exchanging firepower. It connects closely with the game's strategic and tactical components like ship customization, gathering resources, and technological advancements. This ensures that each battle is impacted by wider gameplay choices.
    
    "*Infantry wins battles, logistics wins wars*."
    
12. **[[Multiboxing]]**: In a world where time and distance are important factors, players will spend a lot of time traveling to various locations. To keep players engaged, the game encourages and facilitates multiboxing by allowing pilots to easily switch between available ships.
13. **[[Outposts]]**: outposts play a vital role in establishing player presence and expanding influence across the galaxy. These structures come in two primary forms: Citadels and Temporary Outposts, each serving distinct purposes and offering unique advantages. 
14. Tactical-first combat system:
