**Target audience**

Citadel is pioneering into the realm of native onchain gaming, specifically designed for a core audience accustomed with blockchain technology.  
This game sets out to push the boundaries of what has previously been achieved in web3 gaming environments.  
The initial core target audience for Citadel consists of web3 natives; players who are comfortable navigating blockchain technology and understand its implications both technically and culturally. These players are ~~monk…~~ pioneers, already deeply embedded in the ecosystem of cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and decentralized applications.

**Our approach**

Citadel’s approach to the New Player Experience (NPE) deviate significantly from traditional gaming approaches. Recognizing that our players are accustomed to the community-driven nature of web3, the NPE in Citadel is designed to be inherently social and integrated within the community from the outset.

Instead of structured missions or guided tutorials, new players in Citadel are introduced to the game through direct engagement with the community. This integration is fundamental, as the existing community of players becomes the primary resource for new members, offering insights, guidance, and support directly.

From their first moment in the game, new players are encouraged to connect with other players, participate in community forums, and interact within player-led events. This method not only helps new players acclimate to the game's environment but also immerses them in the collaborative and communal ethos that is the hallmark of web3 cultures.

Learning in Citadel is a communal effort, with knowledge sharing and peer-to-peer education being key. The game environment is designed to support and reward these interactions, ensuring that players contribute to and benefit from the collective wisdom of the community.

In Citadel, alliances are more than just strategic groupings. Given the financial incentives tied to recruitment and growth, Alliances are incentivized to recruit and effectively train new players due to the financial and strategic benefits associated with growing their ranks.
