**Citadels**
Players have the ability to construct and manage various types of structures, each serving different strategic and operational purposes. Among these, Citadels and Temporary Outposts play crucial roles in the establishment of player presence, resource management, and territorial control.

Citadels are the strongest of the player-constructed fortifications, representing significant investments of resources and time. They are the primary strongholds within the game, offering a multitude of functions and benefits to their owners.

Citadels serve as central hubs for player alliances, providing a base of operations for both economic activities and military campaigns. They are equipped with all the facilities needed for refining resources, manufacturing ships and equipment, and conducting research.

Citadels are designed to withstand prolonged sieges and deter enemy attacks. They are equipped with heavy armaments, shield generators, and defensive turrets.

They act as central points for gathering, refining, and distributing minerals, fuel, and other vital resources across a playerâ€™s territory.

Citadels provide enhanced capabilities for coordinating fleet movements, monitoring enemy activities, and planning large-scale operations. They can also have advanced communication systems and intelligence-gathering tools.


**Temporary Outposts**
**Temporary Outposts** are smaller, more versatile structures that players can deploy quickly to establish a foothold in new or contested areas. Unlike Citadels, they are designed for flexibility and short-term use, offering critical support during exploration, resource extraction, and military operations.

Temporary outposts are usually devoted to a single task, whether it be defense, offensive, or intel-related.

Those Outposts can be deployed rapidly, allowing players to quickly establish a presence in strategic locations. This makes them ideal for exploration missions, temporary resource extraction points, and forward operating bases in conflict zones.

These outposts are highly modular, meaning players can equip them with a variety of facilities based on their immediate needs.

Temporary Outposts provide essential resource support, acting as intermediate storage and processing points. They help in bridging the gap between resource-rich areas and central Citadels, ensuring a continuous flow of materials.

Due to their temporary nature, these outposts can be relocated or dismantled as needed. This flexibility allows players to adapt to changing strategic situations, moving their operations closer to newly discovered resources or away from emerging threats.

While not as heavily fortified as Citadels, Temporary Outposts can be equipped with defensive measures such as turrets and shield generators to protect against minor incursions and provide a safe haven for players operating in hostile environments.
