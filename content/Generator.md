In **Citadel**, the ship operational system revolves around efficient power management. The generator on each ship produces a fixed amount of power per second. Any surplus power that is not immediately used is stored in the  [[Capacitor]], which acts as a reserve for additional power needs in case of emergency needs.

Activating all modules simultaneously will likely exceed the generator's recharge capacity (depending on the generator efficiency and capacity), meaning not all systems can operate at maximum efficiency at the same time.

Players can choose to divert power to specific systems to optimize performance. For instance, in combat scenarios, diverting power to weapons systems might be critical, while other systems like sensors or engines might receive less power and operate less efficiently.

Alternatively, players might choose to run one system at full capacity while others operate at reduced efficiency

**Example:**

During exploration, players might prioritize sensors and engines, making them work at 90% max efficiency therefore making the ship going faster and with a better scanning and stealth capacity. Weapons systems might be powered down to 20% energy for these essential functions.

The amount of energy diverted to a module affects its activation time. Lower energy allocation results in a longer duration for the module to reach its maximum power level. This means that players must manage their power distribution to ensure systems are combat-ready when needed.
