The scanning system is integral to exploration, combat, and resource gathering. Players rely on both active and passive scanning techniques to navigate the galaxy, detect hidden objects, and gather crucial information about their surroundings.
### Passive Scanners

**Continuous Monitoring:** Passive scanners provide a constant stream of information without actively emitting signals. These scanners are ideal for stealth operations, early detection, and general situational awareness. They work by passively detecting emissions, energy signatures, and other indicators in the surrounding environment.

**Functions and Capabilities:**

- **Background Detection:** Capable of identifying and tracking ships, structures, and anomalies based on their natural emissions. This includes thermal signatures, electromagnetic fields, and radio frequencies.
- **Environmental Awareness:** Provides detailed information about nearby celestial bodies, asteroid fields, and other natural features. Useful for navigation and identifying potential resource sites.
- **Threat Detection:** Alerts players to the presence of other ships or other hazards without revealing their own position. 


The advantages of  passive scanners are:
* **Longer Range:** Passive scanners have a longer range, allowing for broad and stealthy detection of the environment. 
- **Stealth:** Passive scanners do not emit signals, making them less likely to be detected by enemy scanners. 
- **Energy Efficiency:** Passive scanning consumes less energy compared to active scanning, allowing ships to conserve power for other systems. (TBD, passive scanners might be a out-of-the-box tool of the ship, not a module)

**Limitations:**

- **Limited Detail:** While passive scanners provide broad situational awareness, they lack the detailed resolution of active scanners. They are less effective at pinpointing precise locations or identifying specific details about objects.

### Active Scanners

**Targeted Probing:** Active scanners emit signals to probe the environment, providing detailed and precise information about objects and areas of interest. These scanners are essential for detailed exploration, resource identification, and combat targeting.

**Functions and Capabilities:**

- **Resource Scanning:** Identifies specific types of minerals, gases, and other valuable resources within asteroids, planets, and other celestial bodies. This is crucial for mining operations and resource gathering.
- **Detailed Analysis:** Provides high-resolution data on ships, structures, and anomalies. This includes information on ship types, loadouts, potential weaknesses, and structural integrity.
- **Combat Targeting:** Enhances targeting systems by providing precise location and movement data of enemy ships. This is essential for effective weapon systems and tactical planning.

**Advantages:**

- **High Resolution:** Active scanners offer detailed and accurate information, making them invaluable for resource extraction and combat operations.
- **Extended Range:** Active scanners have an extended range, but it is shorter compared to passive scanners. They provide precise, actionable data within their operational radius, making them perfect for close-to-mid-range engagements and detailed exploration.

**Limitations:**

- **Detectability:** The emissions from active scanners can be detected by other ships, potentially revealing the scanning ship’s position. This increases the risk of detection and engagement by enemies.
- **Energy Consumption:** Active scanning requires more energy, which can strain the ship’s power resources and necessitate careful management of energy allocation.
