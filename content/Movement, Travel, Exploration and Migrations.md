Movement should not be easy to [[Multiboxing]] (in specific PvP situations) and it should allow players to seamlessly embrace and play with the surrounding environment.  
  
Therefore our proposal here is to embrace a modified version of how vector movement actually works with 3 main, interchangeable movement options.  
  
**Vector-based Free Movement**: Players take direct control of the ship’s navigation system, (which provides the player a different user experience from combat system UX). The primary mode of movement allows players to define a forward movement vector (X-axis) that determines the direction the ship will head. Subsequently, they can choose a secondary vector (Y-axis) for upward or downward movement relative to the primary vector. Beyond basic vector setups, players can apply modifiers such as "move to spot," "continue indefinitely in the chosen direction," "perform evasive maneuvers" and so on.  
  
**Quick-Action Movements**: This subset of movement actions provides players with immediate, time-efficient maneuvers that don’t involve complex vector configurations. Commands like "go up," "go left," "go right," and "go down" simplify immediate positional adjustments during battles or tight navigational scenarios. Players are prompted with a single locked vector and only need to specify the distance.  
  
**Environment-Based Movement**: The second major type of movement takes into account the surrounding environment, allowing the pilot to dynamically interact with space objects and conditions. Actions like "approach," "keep at distance," or "move inside" enable pilots to maneuver in relation to other objects or locations (and their shape).
