Hardpoints are both a ship's biggest strengths, and also its biggest weaknesses. Without hardpoints, a ship can't move or interact with the world, but they're also the path of least resistance for anything wishing to enter. Especially the engine is vulnerable to, as a critical hit can ignite the fuel tank and cause massive internal damage. This is conveniently a strong incentive for players to not turn tail and flee from combat. Other hardpoints can also be target, though the consequence of their destruction will simply be inoperable hardpoints and exposed inner equipment. Care should therefore be taken to not position critical infrastructure right next to hardpoints.
