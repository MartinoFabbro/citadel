We recognize the importance of maintaining the integrity of travel times and the vast game geography. Consequently, travel demands significant time and effort. To ensure that players remain engaged and can manage their fleets effectively, we introduce a ship jumping mechanic that allows pilots to switch between ships they have access to at will. This system is designed to promote continuous interaction with the game, whether players are engaged in PvP or PvE.

Under certain conditions, players can hop on and off any ship they have access to, regardless of whether it is located in space or in a hangar. This flexibility allows pilots to respond dynamically to changing situations.

 **Access Permissions:** Pilots must have the necessary permissions to access and control the target ship. These permissions can be managed through the game's ACL (Access Control List) system, allowing ship owners to define who can jump into their vessels.

The game's UX is specifically designed to support and promote ship jumping, for example alerts and notifications must be introduced to keep players informed about the status of their ships, enabling timely responses to emerging threats or opportunities.
