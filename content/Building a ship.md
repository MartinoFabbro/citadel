Based on the concept of material differentiation, in Citadel is it possible to use a multitude of materials to build a ship off a blueprint.

Let's make an example with some basic stats:

**Ship Blueprint**: Interceptor
**Role**: High-speed, High-efficiency reconnaissance and light combat operations.
**Base Specs**: 

- **Hull Durability:** 1000 HP
- **Speed:** 400 m/s
- TBD

To achieve the optimal performance for the Starhawk Interceptor, high-quality materials must be used.

**Perfect Materials:**

- **Hull Durability:** 1200 HP
- **Speed:** 506 m/s

**Subpar Materials:**

- **Hull Durability:** 900 HP
- **Speed:** 340 m/s


**Material requirements**

- 5 Titanium Plates 
- 1 Engine bay gateway
- 10 Electronic superconductors
- 2500 Steel rigs
- ...
