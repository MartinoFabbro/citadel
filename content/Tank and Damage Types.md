Eve has two tank types and four damage types.
```
|----- EM ----|-- thermal --|-- kinetic --|- explosive -|
|---------- shield ---------|---------- armor ----------|
```
EM is strong against shield, but weak against armor. Explosive is strong against armor, but weak against shield. Thermal and kinetic are somewhat in the middle, but skewed towards shield and armor respectively.

Eve also has a concept of evasion, but this concept is very poorly explored in Eve. We can do better! First, let's introduce a 3rd tank type: organic. Secondly, let's embrace evasion! All ships will have one of the three tank types as their primary defence *and* specialize in either evasion or tank. Evasion will not work like Eve where it is a gimmick that only works in certain situations, but an equally valid form of defense as more hitpoints. Weapons are locked to different types of damage, which have varying effectiveness based on the target's choice of tank type. In the example below, there are six different damage types, but more granularity can be added. In addition, each weapon has a high tracking and high damage variation. Just like damage types have a corresponding tank type, The tracking variation will always be superior against evasion-based ships, and the damage variation will always be superior against tank-based ships. This gives a total of six different defensive configurations, and at least 12 different weapon configurations.

The different regions of the game will have resources with varying affinity for the different tank and damage types to ensure verity and force players to adapt to different metas. While ships can have an affinity for a tank or damage type based on fitting resources, it's important to not have bonii to specific tank or damage type, as doing so will shoehorn certain configurations.
