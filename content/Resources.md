### **Introduction**

During the first phase of the game, the Citadel economy primarily depends on two primary resources: mineral deposits and fuel nebulae, which sustain the initial game play loops.

In Citadel, strategic resource distribution is a central aspect of the entire game as it influences economic dynamics, player strategies, and alliances. Each galaxy has a "fulcrum," the central area with the most abundant concentration of minerals, highly desirable for groups aiming to profit from its richness.

As players move further from the center, mineral deposits decrease while fuel nebulae increase, making fuel nebulae more abundant the closer a pilot gets to the map's edge.

Mineral extraction is one of the main activities players will carry out; different types of minerals are present within the world, each with specific attributes that make them better suited for building specific ships and objects. For example, lightweight and high-strength materials might specialize in sleek, fast attack ships, while resources suited for high durability might produce more robust and heavily armored vessels and modules.

The interplay between mineral richness and fuel availability dictates lot of of the strategic movement and settlement patterns within Citadel, demanding adaptation in strategy as players project their reach towards both the outer edges and the fulcrum.

This distribution ensures that no single area holds all advantages, promoting a dynamic balance of power and resource management across the galaxy.

The economy in Citadel is heavily influenced by the scarcity and abundance cycles of resources. Market prices for various goods will fluctuate based on availability, extraction costs, and technological advancements, creating a competitive market environment.

Players can gain economic leverage by controlling resource nodes or specializing in the trade of specific minerals and fuels, influencing not only economic decisions but also tactical planning. Alliances and individual players must consider their proximity to resource-rich areas when planning their [[supply chains]].

### Minerals

In Citadel, similarly to other games, minerals play a crucial role in the game play dynamics, serving as essential resources for constructing ships, outposts, modules and more. Minerals have different properties and categorizations

#### **Types and Properties of Minerals**

Minerals in games typically vary across several dimensions that affect their use in crafting and construction. Here are some of the common properties that distinguish different minerals:

1. **Density:** Affects how much a mineral weighs and how much space it occupies, properties which influence the design and function of structures and ships. High-density minerals are commonly used in heavy armor and fortifications modules, while low-density minerals are to be preferred for components that aim at reducing the overall mass of the item/ship.
2. **Hardness:** Determines a mineral's resistance. Harder minerals are ideal for creating durable surfaces and protective coatings, essential for combat ships and defensive structures.
3. **Conductivity:** This can refer to either thermal or electrical conductivity. Minerals with high electrical conductivity are crucial for electronic components and power systems, while those with high thermal conductivity are used in power grid management systems.
4. **Targeted Resistance Properties of Minerals:** This refers to minerals that exhibit specific resistance to different types of weaponry are crucial for crafting defensive components tailored to varied combat scenarios. Certain minerals might be particularly effective at absorbing or deflecting energy-based attacks, making them ideal for shielding against lasers or plasma weapons. Others might possess high resistance to physical damage, such as projectiles or explosive impacts.
5. **Strength**
6. **Brittleness** and **Solidity**
7. **Magnetism**: The higher the magnetism of the material the higher will be the signature radius of the ship.

#### **Categories of Minerals**

Minerals can be broadly categorized based on their common uses and properties into several groups:

1. **Structural Minerals:** Used primarily in construction due to their strength, durability, or weight characteristics. Real world examples include titanium and steel alloys, known for their hardness and density.
    
2. **Electronic Minerals:** These minerals have properties that make them suitable for use in electronics and electrical systems, real world examples include copper and gold, known for their excellent electrical conductivity.
    
3. **Energy Minerals:** Critical for energy storage and power generation systems. Uranium and thorium may fall into this category.
    
4. **Composite Materials (Alloys):** Often manufactured from multiple types of minerals, these materials are designed to offer the best qualities of their constituent components. Carbon fiber composites are an example, valued for their strength-to-weight ratio.
    
5. **Precious Minerals:** Typically rare and used for high-value applications, including economic (trade or currency) or advanced technological applications. Examples might include platinum and rare earth elements.
    
6. **Utility Minerals:** Commonly used for general-purpose applications across various aspects of gameplay, such as silica for glass or limestone for basic building materials.
    

Various minerals can be used to construct different items, but certain minerals will be more suitable for specific purposes, even if they are not exclusive to the blueprint BOM.

### **Fuel and its implications**

Fuel is essential for the operation of ships, from small fighters and batteleships to capital ships. It powers engines for travel between points in space, operates various ship systems, and, in some cases, fuels weapons. Fuel is a top priority for players as it affects decisions on exploring, expanding, and engaging in activities.

Control over fuel resources and supply lines can grant significant strategic advantages. Players or alliances that secure fuel-rich areas can maintain longer operational capacities and enforce control over crucial chokepoints or trade routes. Conversely, a shortage of fuel can cripple military campaigns and hinder economic development.

Fuel availability influences how far players can venture from established bases or safe zones. The need to refuel can dictate the pace and direction of exploration, making fuel depots and efficient supply chains critical for territorial expansion.

Fuel not only drives the game's physical operations but also its economy. It can be a highly traded commodity, with prices fluctuating based on availability, control of extraction points, and geopolitical events in the game.
