Constructing new ships or items begins with obtaining a blueprint. This system is designed to encourage continuous improvement and dynamic gameplay, discouraging stockpiling and ensuring that newer items remain more effective than older ones.

Blueprints are widely available in the game and can be acquired through various means such as exploration, trade, missions, or market purchases. Each blueprint provides the basic specifications required to construct a ship or item.

Once obtained, blueprints can be continuously researched to improve the output item’s stats. This research process is key to maintaining competitive edges in the game:

- **Indefinite Improvement:** Players can research their blueprints indefinitely, enhancing aspects such as durability, efficiency, and power. This ensures that older ships or items become progressively less competitive compared to upgraded versions

- **Research Aggressiveness:** Players can choose the aggressiveness of their research. More aggressive research speeds up the improvement process but also increases the chances of research failure, adding a risk-reward element to blueprint advancement.

Similar to _EVE Online_, blueprints must be placed in stasis during the research process. This means that the blueprint cannot be used to construct new items while it is being upgraded.

### Factors Influencing Final Performance

**Material Quality:** The type of materials used in construction significantly impacts the final item’s attributes:

- **Standard Alloys:** Provide reliable performance but may not maximize the blueprint’s potential.
- **Expensive Alloys:** Enhance the final item's attributes, making it more durable, efficient, or powerful.

**Construction Facility Quality:** The quality of the construction facilities also plays a crucial role:

- **Basic Facilities:** Capable of producing items to standard specifications.
- **Upgraded Facilities:** Can significantly boost production speed and quality, leveraging advanced technology to bring out the best in the blueprints.

### Scaling of Traits

**Linear vs. Logarithmic Scaling:** Not all item traits can be improved linearly. For traits such as ship speed, a logarithmic scaling approach is used:

- **Linear Scaling:** Suitable for traits like durability or weapon power, where incremental improvements can continue to provide benefits.
- **Logarithmic Scaling:** For traits like speed, improvements become less impactful over time, reflecting realistic constraints and ensuring balanced gameplay.

This system is designed to discourage stockpiling by ensuring that older ships and items underperform compared to newer, upgraded versions.

The ability to research and upgrade blueprints creates a dynamic market where advanced blueprints and high-quality materials are in constant demand.
