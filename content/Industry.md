Citadel industrial system comprehends a myriads of different aspects, starting from the entire process of resource extraction, processing, and manufacturing, allowing players to construct ships, outposts, and various items.

This chapter serves as a general overview of every game-play loop required to build the final product.

### **Industry Key Concepts**

**[[Resources]] extraction**

**Mining**: Players can mine minerals and other raw materials from asteroids, planets, and other celestial bodies. The quality and type of materials vary based on location and mining technology.

**Fuel Harvesting**: Fuel sources, such as gas nebulae, can be harvested to power ships and outposts. 

**[[Material Quality and Tiers]]**

**Quality Categorization**: Minerals and other resources are categorized into different quality tiers. Higher-quality materials provide better performance and efficiency in manufactured goods.

**[[Processing and Refining]]**

**Refining Facilities:** Raw materials must be processed and refined before they can be used in manufacturing. Players can build and upgrade refining facilities to improve efficiency and output quality.

Also, a material can be refined as many times as the player want, this process allows to reduce material impurities at the expense of the amount of material that are wasted during this iterative process

**[[Blueprints]]**

**Blueprints**: To construct ships, outposts, and items, players need blueprints. These can be obtained through exploration and trade and provide the specifications for manufacturing.

**Construction Facilities**: Players use industrial outposts equipped with shipyards and factories to build their assets. The quality of these facilities affects production speed, efficiency, and the quality of the final product.

**[[Supply chains]]**

**Resource Transport**: Efficient transport of resources between extraction sites, processing facilities, and manufacturing plants is crucial. Players can use cargo ships, fuel tankers, and automated supply routes.

**Security and Defense**: Supply chains need to be protected from piracy and enemy factions. Players must deploy defensive measures and escort fleets to ensure the safe transport of resources.
