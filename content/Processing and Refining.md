From raw material extraction to the finished product...

### Extraction

As mentioned in the [[Resources]] section, mining operations begin with extracting raw materials in their most unrefined state, containing various impurities and mixed mineral content. Once extracted, the raw minerals are transported to a processing facility, which could be an outpost equipped with basic processing capabilities. The initial step involves sorting the raw materials to separate the valuable minerals from the waste rock and other impurities.

### Refining Cycles

The first refining cycle typically occurs in a basic refinery. This facility processes the raw minerals, reducing impurities and increasing the concentration of the desired material. Each refining cycle results in some loss of material. 

The more impurities are removed, the greater the loss in volume, but the higher the quality of the output material. After the first cycle, the mineral purity improves, but it might still not reach the desired quality for high-end construction.

Players can choose to process the minerals further using more advanced refining facilities. These refineries offer higher efficiency and can achieve greater purity levels. Each subsequent refining cycle further reduces impurities, requiring players to balance the increased material loss against the benefits of higher purity.

**Example Process:**

1. Extracting 10,000 units of raw Watermelonium ore.
2. The first refining cycle yields 7,000 units of Watermelonium with 0.4 purity (C Tier).
3. The second refining cycle yields 4,900 units of Watermelonium with 0.6 purity (B Tier).
4. The third refining cycle yields 3,430 units of Watermelonium with 0.8 purity (A Tier).

### Final Product

After multiple refining cycles, the final product has significantly higher purity, enhancing its attributes such as strength, conductivity, or durability. High-purity materials are essential for constructing advanced ships, weapons, and other high-performance items. 

The quality of the final product directly impacts its effectiveness and efficiency in the game. Higher-purity materials also have greater market value. Players can trade refined materials for profit or use them to gain a competitive edge in constructing superior technology.
### Refining Facilities

Refining facilities come in different types. Basic refineries are suitable for initial processing and first refining cycles, but they are less efficient and result in higher material loss compared to advanced facilities. Advanced refineries are capable of multiple refining cycles with better efficiency and lower material loss. 

These require significant investment but yield higher-quality materials. Specialized refineries are tailored for specific refining techniques, offering targeted impurity removal and exceptional material quality.

Players can invest in upgrading their refining facilities to improve efficiency, reduce material loss, and enhance the final product's quality. Upgrades might include better equipment, advanced technology integration, and increased capacity.
