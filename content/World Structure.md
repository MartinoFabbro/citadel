## **Introduction**

In Citadel, the concept of finite resources serves as the primary catalyst for migration, creating a dynamic cycle of settlement, exploitation, depletion, and movement that drives the narrative and continuously reshapes the political landscape. As players and alliances consume the available resources in a galaxy, they face diminishing returns that compel them to make critical decisions about conserving resources, optimizing their use, or seeking new territories. The rate of resource depletion is directly linked to player activity,

Traveling to a new galaxy in Citadel is designed to be a significant undertaking with substantial costs. These costs are not just financial but also strategic, as players must decide what to leave behind, including [[Outposts]] and non-essential assets. This migration effectively acts as a 'soft reset,' reducing the accumulation of power and wealth to a degree and fostering new strategies and alliances.

The strategic placement of resources is crucial in Citadel. High-value resources are positioned in the central areas of the galaxy, necessitating strategic thinking around where to establish outposts and how to defend them.

Conversely, essential fuel supplies are located in the outer sectors, making these areas strategic for fuel stockpiling and energy supply lines (_see [[supply chains]] paragraph_). Players must weigh the benefits of proximity to valuable central resources against the risks of increased competition and conflict, while also considering the safer, albeit less rewarding, opportunities of setting up in the outer sectors.

Players must also manage defensive strategies, securing their territories while maintaining mobility for potential evacuations and migrations. Alliances play a critical role in survival and expansion.

To be more specific regarding the galaxy concept, the game map is designed with a shape that directly influences gameplay, resource distribution, and player movement. The map is conceptualized not as a flat, uniform space but as a gradually constricting environment that narrows as one moves towards the center, known as the fulcrum.

As players move towards the center of the map, the playable area narrows vertically, creating a constrained environment and boosting competition.

### **Sectors and their uniqueness**

The galaxy map is divided into different regions, each one designed to offer distinct gameplay experiences, resource distributions, and tactical challenges.

Each [[Sectors]] in the game map has a unique combination of resources, fuel, and environment. Differences between sectors include varying mineral abundance, access to fuel nebulae, and environmental features that can significantly impact gameplay strategies.

Players need to adjust their strategies and fleets to match the characteristics of the sector they are in. Environmental factors influence the types of ships and tactics that work best, requiring players to either specialize or diversify their abilities to align with their location and goals.
