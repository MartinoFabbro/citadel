The game map is divided into various sectors, each with unique characteristics and strategic implications. These sectors are shaped not only by resource distribution and environmental features but also by the presence of megastructures that serve as natural chokepoints. This  ensures that each sector provides a distinct gameplay experience from another (keeping the same artistic characteristics as every other one), challenging players to adapt their strategies accordingly.

Resource rich central sectors are located near the fulcrum, they are dense with valuable minerals. 

The high concentration of resources makes these areas highly desirable and fiercely contested. The central sectors are characterized by narrower vertical spaces, leading to frequent player encounters and conflicts. The presence of numerous megastructures in these sectors creates natural chokepoints, further intensifying competition.

Fuel-rich outer sectors are located towards the edges of the map, these sectors are abundant in fuel nebulae. The broader spaces here allow for easier navigation and less crowded conditions. While these sectors are critical for extracting the fuel needed to power ships and outposts, the strategic challenge lies in defending these often remote areas from hunters and ensuring a steady supply chain back to the central areas

Sitting between the central and outer sectors, these transition zones offer a balance of minerals and fuel. These sectors can serve as buffer zones and are often used for expansion and consolidation of power.
