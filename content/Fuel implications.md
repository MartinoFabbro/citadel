Once extracted, raw fuel from nebula must be refined into usable fuel types. Refined fuel is essential for powering ships, outposts, and various equipment.

Fuel is required for all ship travel, including both short-range manoeuvres and long-range jumps between sectors or galaxies. The amount of fuel consumed depends on the distance travelled and the size of the ship.

But what happens when a ship runs out of fuel?

Once the ship fuel is fully depleted, the ship stops working, and is not able to travel further, the only way to retrieve this ship is if a friend bring him some fuel.

However, we implement a sort of guard-rail to prevent players running out of fuel unintentionally. Below a 20% Fuel Threshold, the ship's utility modules (harvesters, etc.) will be disabled, so only propulsion and defence is possible. This will force players to return to their base to refuel before becoming stranded.

Moreover, each and every ship, can fit a small portable fuel converter that is able to refine raw fuel nebulae into actual usable fuel, that would allow players to sustain longer covert operations in uncharted or unfriendly territories.
